Do you ever feel unmotivated when it comes to working out? Do you find that working out with a friend helps you 
efficiently achieve your goal, but all your friends happen to be busy? HibernateLater is the app that combats both of 
these obstacles. A little bear companion will be cheering you on while you work out and will even keep you accountable
on your breaks! This app is more than a workout tracker, it's a portable fitness pal!

Created in Android Studio

When cloning the repository, the local.properties will have a different SDK than the one set in your path. Make sure 
to change this before running the app!
